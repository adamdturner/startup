# startup

Here are the notes I will be taking for this class in the [notes.md](https://github.com/adamdturner/startup/blob/688eea9d56f049f68e8a7ad01f3f23ac15ce6375/notes.md) file.

## Deliverables:
In this section I will write notes for each deliverable to show the graders what I have been working on and changing during each step.

### 1. Specification Deliverable
Elevator Pitch:
It is the number 1 task manager for groups or individuals. Task manager is a simple tool for for managing daily tasks or projects. Users can create accounts, add tasks, set deadlines, and mark tasks as complete. Users will also have the option to create group task lists where anyone in the group is capable of adding tasks or checking them off; when a task is completed by someone in the group, everyone else is notified. The user who creates the list is considered the list admin and they are the only one capable of adding new people to the group. It is great for a family who needs to get a list of chores done around the house or a study group splitting up the homework. It could even be used as a packing list for a group camping trip to make sure all of the supplies are brought.
