      <p>
          Task Manager is a way to organize your own personal lists. This could be a to-do list, 
          a homework list or a shopping list. Anything that you need to keep track of can be orgainzed 
          into a personal list that shows you what is complete and what is incomplete.
      </p>
  
      <p>
          You can also add other users to your list, allowing them permission to add things to the list 
          and also check things off when they are completed. Let's say you are preparing for a camping 
          trip and everyone is supposed to bring items like tents stoves etc. You can create a list of 
          items you need and each person can check off the items that they have packed. It notifies everyone 
          when someone checks off something on the list.
