# Notes.md

## Week 1 Day 2
I've learned how to clone repositories and create files within the repositories. I also learned that you can include a link from one file to another within a file. For example, my README.md file has a link to my notes file.

I learned how conflicts can be created when trying to commit changes to a line of code at the same time as pulling changes that were made to the same line of code. I learned how these conflicts can be resolved in the development environment and pushed to sync with the main branch.

## Week 1 Day 3
In my startup application I added the elevator pitch, design images, and an explanation of the key features and technologies used.

## Week 2 Day 5 and 6
I learned about the history of the web and created my own instance of an AWS server using Amazon AWS services. 

This is the website with my server IP address:

### http://34.198.26.40/

This is the command to remote shell into my server:

### ssh -i [path to keypair file] ubuntu@34.198.26.40

## Week 3 Day 7
I registered my own domain name using route 53 with amazon. The domain name that I picked is adam260startup.click
I learned how to connect the connect the domain to the server IP address and also learned to use Caddy and Let's Encrypt to make the website traffic secure.
It is now possible to go to the website through it's new domain:
https://adam260startup.click

## Week 3 Day 9
I learned about proper html formatting with Header, Main and Footer sections as well as creating lists and tables within those sections. HTML is simply just the main format of you everything is layed out and sectioned off but it is not what makes the web page look really nice in the end. Fonts, colors and animations are done later in CSS. 

## Week 4 Day 11
I learned about how CSS and HTML are linked together to be able to provide a more asthetic look to the web page. You can use CSS on sections of HTML code to change colors of text or background as well as include animations or movement to text and images in the page.
