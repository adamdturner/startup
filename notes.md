# Notes.md

## Week 1 Day 2
I've learned how to clone repositories and create files within the repositories. I also learned that you can include a link from one file to another within a file. For example, my README.md file has a link to my notes file.

I learned how conflicts can be created when trying to commit changes to a line of code at the same time as pulling changes that were made to the same line of code. I learned how these conflicts can be resolved in the development environment and pushed to sync with the main branch.

## Week 1 Day 3
In my startup application I added the elevator pitch, design images, and an explanation of the key features and technologies used.

## Week 2 Day 5 and 6
I learned about the history of the web and created my own instance of an AWS server using Amazon AWS services. 

This is the website with my server IP address:

### http://34.198.26.40/

This is the command to remote shell into my server:

### ssh -i [path to keypair file] ubuntu@107.23.7.60
